# AWS - Data Pipeline
Description: Setup data pipeline using AWS for E-Commerce dataset

# Introduction and Goals
The purpose of this personal project is to establish a data pipeline for e-commerce data to be transported to a PowerBI dashboard for business analysts. There are many issues to be considered and many individual components that influence your ability to consolidate data within a company. A few of the initial considerations when beginning this project:

- Data Sources: Internal operational database for transactions, CRM platforms, CSV or other file datasets.
- Data Quality: The quality of the data being processesed directly impacts the services and tooling required to properly store and use the data for analytical purposes.
- Internal Customers: All data pipelines have the potential to services multiple end clients inside the company rather than just a single group. There may be sales teams, executive level individuals, supply chain teams, machine maintenance teams and many more who require the pipeline to provide value for them.
- Documentation: For each of the outputs that your pipeline connects to (dashboards, warehouses, data lakes, etc) all have an end use and a process that involves many source streams and transformations. All this required proper documentations and testing to ensure that the tema knows how each piece works and can quickly respond to issues that arise.
